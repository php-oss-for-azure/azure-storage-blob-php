## Install

```shell
composer require azure-oss/storage-blob
```

## Quickstart

```php
<?php

use AzureOss\Storage\Blob\BlobServiceClient;
use AzureOss\Storage\Blob\Models\UploadBlobOptions;

$service = BlobServiceClient::fromConnectionString(
    getenv('AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING')
);

$container = $service->getContainerClient('quickstart');
$container->createIfNotExists();

$blob = $container->getBlobClient('hello.txt');

$blob->upload(
    'Hello from PHP OSS for Azure',
    new UploadBlobOptions(contentType: 'text/plain')
);

$download = $blob->downloadStreaming();
$content = $download->content->getContents();

echo $content.PHP_EOL; // Hello from PHP OSS for Azure

foreach ($container->getBlobs() as $item) {
    echo $item->name.PHP_EOL;
}

// Optional cleanup
$blob->deleteIfExists();
// $container->deleteIfExists();
```

## Features

- Authentication:
  - Connection strings (access keys)
  - Shared key credentials
  - Shared access signatures (SAS) for delegated, time-limited access
  - Microsoft Entra ID (token-based authentication) via azure-oss/azure-identity
- Local development:
  - Supports the Azurite emulator
- Containers:
  - Create, delete, and list (including filtering by prefix)
  - Configure public access when creating a container
  - Read properties and manage metadata
  - Acquire, renew, change, release, and break leases
  - List and restore soft-deleted containers
- Blobs:
  - Upload from strings or streams, with transfer tuning for large uploads
  - Set common HTTP headers (content type, cache control, etc.)
  - Download via streaming and access response properties
  - Protect reads and writes with ETag, date, and lease ID conditions
  - Acquire, renew, change, release, and break leases
  - Copy blobs (synchronous and asynchronous)
  - List blobs (flat, by prefix, and hierarchical listing) with page sizing
  - Delete and restore soft-deleted blobs
  - Create, read, copy, and delete snapshots
  - Select, read, restore, and delete blob versions
  - Read properties and manage metadata
  - Blob index tags: set/get tags and query blobs by tags (account or container scope)
- SAS:
  - Generate SAS for blobs, containers, and the account (when using credentials that can sign SAS)
